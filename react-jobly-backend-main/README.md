# react-jobly-backend
Back end files for Springboard project using React to make the front end of a job application app.

This code was entirely provided by Springboard, to be used in project focusing on React.

I did previously write a program with the same functionality.  It is located at https://github.com/bpruitt63/node-and-express/tree/main/express-jobly
